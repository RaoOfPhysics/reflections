Science writers are always trying to think of fascinating story ideas that can be backed up with research.
Inspiration might spring from the most unlikely of sources, like a nonsense musing on _Seinfeld_ or the historical minutiae of a Trivial Pursuit question.
The hard part is finding research about these obscure, fleeting puzzlings. My quest often goes unfulfilled.

Luckily, there is a prize that motivates researchers to conduct just these kinds of investigations.
For figuring out things like [why woodpeckers don't get headaches](http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/20061011_ig_nobel_schwab/index.html), or how to [un-boil an egg](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fcbic.201402427), or [whether banana skins actually make you slip](https://dx.doi.org/10.2474%2Ftrol.7.147), intrepid scientists are awarded the [Ig Nobel Prize](http://www.improbable.com/ig/), the down-to-earth and tongue-in-cheek Nobel Prize spoof that is surprisingly revealing about what counts as relatable science and how the scientific method can be brought to bear on the humorous, the smutty, and the bizarre.
(The 2016 Ig Nobel ceremony on September 22 is being [livestreamed here](http://www.improbable.com/ig/2016/).)

In no particular order, here are some Ig Nobel-worthy contenders, as proposed by the Twitterverse:
* [When zombies attack: mathematical modelling of an outbreak of zombie infection](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ted/203S10/Projects/Zombies/Zombies.pdf) (Related: [A mathematical model of Bieber Fever: the most infectious disease of our time?](http://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/rsmith43/BieberFever.pdf))
* [The ethics of human-chicken relationships in video games: the origins of the digital chicken](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2874254) (chicken-related research has scored at least four Ig Nobels so far)
* [Misperceiving bullshit as profound is associated with favorable views of Cruz, Rubio, Trump and conservatism](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0153419)
* [Spider behaviors include oral sexual encounters](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25128)
* [Are “armchair socialists” still sitting? Cross sectional study of political affiliation and physical activity](http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7073)
* [Endocannabinoid signaling enhances visual responses through modulation of intracellular chloride levels in retinal ganglion cells](https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e15932) (as in, pot improves tadpole vision)
* [Searching for Mr. Hyde: A five-factor approach to characterizing “types of drunks”](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/16066359.2015.1029920)
* [A psychological formula for explaining the 'missing socks phenomenon'](http://mentalfloss.com/article/83809/can-washing-machines-really-eat-socks)
* [Affective forecasting in an orangutan: predicting the hedonic outcome of novel juice mixes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27515937)

A good rule of thumb is that studying animals or quirky behavior is likely to yield a result that "makes people laugh, and then makes them think" ([levitating frogs](http://www.ru.nl/hfml/research/levitation/diamagnetic/), anyone?).
But there are still plenty of wild and wacky things that just haven't been studied yet, so here are a few ideas for which I couldn't find scholarly literature or historical information.
Perhaps some enterprising scientist would like to take a crack at these?
And if any of these questions already have solid research-based answers that my cursory Googling overlooked, I want to hear about it!

* Why do you always get into the slowest line at the grocery store?
* Why are credit cards, IDs and business cards all the same size? [There's an international standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_7810), but how did it come about?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That&#39;s a research paper right there, formulating the problem &amp; comparing it with actual results. At least worth an Ignobel prize.</p>&mdash; Achintya Kambli (@achinto_k) <a href="https://twitter.com/achinto_k/status/726070905705623552">April 29, 2016</a></blockquote>

* Are near-sighted people messier? Drawing on my own experience studying near-sighted people, I've wondered whether the blur of being near-sighted obscures small stuff like dirt and hair. This is evidenced especially in bathrooms, where near-sighted people often take off their glasses or it's otherwise steamy.
* Are the values of precious metals and gemstones in any way correlated with their refractive index or other optical properties?
Does shinier mean pricier?
* Has anyone analyzed whether particular airplane safety videos or demonstrations are more effective than others?
* How do the brains of expatriates change over time, especially with regard to attrition of their native language?

And finally, why do we come up with the best ideas in the shower, while brushing our teeth, or just as we're about to fall asleep? This blog post, naturally, was composed with toothpaste froth.
